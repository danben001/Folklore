            <p class="text">Folklore is a major component of culture. Sharing tales, music, games, proverbs and jokes is part of human nature. Folklore is not a relic of the past, but rather a living, breathing entity that evolves and grows with us. The many traditions and beliefs we follow today had their origins in the folklore of our ancestors which were past down by word of mouth, shifting to the needs of their time.


</p>
<p class="text">The goal of this website is to depict Folklore not only through spoken word as much folklore is, but to also provide the added visual and interactive elements of adding comic illustrations and trivia to these folktales to encourage the preservation of our culture's history.
