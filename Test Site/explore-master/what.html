          <p class="text">The definition of folklore is the the traditional beliefs, customs, and stories of a community, passed through the generations by word of mouth.

          </p>

          <p class="text">Folklore is a major component of culture. Sharing tales, music, games, proverbs and jokes is part of human nature. Folklore is not a relic of the past, but rather a living, breathing entity that evolves and grows with us.
            The many traditions and beliefs we follow today had their origins in the folklore of our ancestors which were past down by word of mouth, shifting to the needs of their time.


          </p>
          <p class="text">The goal of this website is to depict folklore not only through spoken word as much folklore is, but to also provide the added visual and interactive elements of adding comic illustrations and trivia to these folktales to
            encourage the preservation of our culture's history.

          <h3 class="secondary-header">Resources on Irish Folklore.</h3>
          <p class="text">The folklore depicted on this site was adapted from Geoffrey Keating's "Foras Feasa ar Éirinn" (The History of Ireland). Geoffrey Keating was a Catholic Priest from Tipperary who's writings are a great source of stories and
            history from 17th century Ireland.
            Another famous figure in documenting folklore is Lady Gregory, who collected and documented Folklore over multiple books until the 20th centruy. The works of Lady Gregory and Geoffrey Keating are still available today in digital and print
            forms.
